Spatium Gestu (latin: "Space Gesture") is a project demonstrating how to create a Manuvrable. This particular project uses the MGC3130 (via the Hillstar development board) to build a gesture pad. The project was named "Space Gesture" because the MGC3130 uses electric field distortions over an area to infer the position of a user's hand. The first-order data so derived is used to return positional information and some simple gesture events to the user's software.

Positional accuracy with the MGC3130 is very good, and the gesture-detection algorithms are robust. We will tie the events so generated to baked-in ManuvrOS messages to issue position reports to a counterparty.

####What is in this repository:
**./doc**:  Documentation related to this project. 


----------------------
####Installation
This project depends upon [ManuvrOS](https://github.com/jspark311/ManuvrOS). So you will need to checkout that source code as well. Clone the repo and follow the installation instructions within it.

----------------------
####Because this project is meant to be used in an Arduino-esque environment...
To overcome the Arduino library-within-library limitation, please follow [these instructions](http://www.joshianlindsay.com/index.php?id=147) to make your IDE treat gcc a little better:
